        <h1>WOODS ARE YOUR FRIENDS</h1>
        <p>Introduction to <b>the woods</b>,<span class="july">July 13, 2022</span></p>
        <article class="article">
          <p>The action of cambium in temperate perennial plants begins in the spring. During this period, the wood produced is the spring wood or early wood.
          The cells of wood which are produced at later parts of the growth season are autumn wood or summer or late wood. Environmental conditions have a sharp
          impact on the formation of the secondary xylem. During favourable conditions, i.e., at the time of summer and spring,the cambium is active producing
          ample amounts of wood. Here, the wood has a light colour comprising wider and larger xylem elements. It is referred to as early or spring wood.Late wood
          or Autumn WoodThe cambium is less active at the time of autumn and winter producing lesser quantities of wood. Such a wood is darker in appearance and
          comprises narrow and small xylem componentswith relatively thicker walls. Such a cambium is referred to as late wood or autumn wood.</p>
